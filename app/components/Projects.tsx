The application uses the Java Swing library to create the game window and manage the game loop. The GamePanel class, which is instantiated in the main method, handles the game logic, rendering, and user input. The project served as an introduction to event-driven programming, object-oriented design principles, and the structure of a simple game engine.A video demonstration is also attached.",
